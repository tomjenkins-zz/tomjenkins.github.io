Hi! I'm Tom. I am a technological theorist and critical designer.

I'm interested in thinking about how people approach technology as a cultural product and in developing new ways for technological expression to promote humanistic experience.

Right now, I'm a PhD student in the [Public Design Workshop](http://publicdesignworkshop.net) at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu)'s [Digital Media](http://dm.gatech.edu) program. I completed my Master's studies at [NYU](http://nyu.edu)'s [Interactive Telecommunications Program](http://itp.nyu.edu). In undergraduate, I worked with the Culturally Embedded Computing group at Cornell University.

If you want to get in contact with me, I can be reached at tom@thomasjenkins.net.

A medium inspired Jekyll blog theme. The basic idea came from the Ghost theme 
[Readium 2.0](http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/). I use mediator on my own blog [The Base](blog.base68.com).

You can **download** the theme here:
